# SUNYUlster
## A repository to organize materials and work for independent study on software development practices, with a focus on applications to data science.

Professor Sheehan,

I've uploaded a proposed study plan for this independent study. It's a little heavy on the reading and guided online learning, and a little light on programming assigments right now. However, my intention is a do a programming heavy final project, probably involving making a simple package in R. I'm open to other assignments or deliverables as you see appropriate, though I think this is a good start. Here's the link:

The data group that I am doing volunteer work at Bard is setting up a github repository right now, so it may be that I have relevant things to collaborate on this Fall and stretch myself with Github skills. However, I will make contrived examples if I need to in order to better practice going through the motions of using Git and Github functionally with good commmunciation practices. 

Learning Objectives: \
-get an overview of Agile and Scrum principles and practices \
-develop comfort using tools and workflow for collaboration and version control with Git and Github \
-understand the basics of what it is needed to create packages in Python and R \
-practice creating an R package 

Deliverables: \
-proof of completion of the three Datacamp courses \ 
-documentation (in Github) that I have followed through on my goals for Github actions \
-final project proposal \
-final project 

Here are the three Datacamp courses listed on the study proposal: \
