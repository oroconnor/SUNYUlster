# Independent Study - Software Development Practices

# This is a test .R file.

# I have git installed on my local computer, and I am practicing adding a commit
# to github.

# I am going to try from the command terminal. And if that's successful, I will
# try directly from RStudio, the IDE that I use for programming in R.

# Let's see how it goes!

# After successfully making the commit from the terminal yesterday, I am now trying 
# to alter this document and make a commit from the RStudio IDE. 

print("Hello, Github")
